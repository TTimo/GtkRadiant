    Rambetter on Sun Jan 23, 2011:

    What follows is a discussion of the introduction to some new members and functions
    such as baseFilters, baseFilterExcludes, FilterAddImpl(), and so on.

    There was a problem that "base" filters were not taking effect as a result of
    user action such as clicking a filter checkbox.  The reason why the base filters
    were not being updated is because the previous logic of updating the filters had
    been commented out.  It was commented out because the previous logic deleted ALL
    filters (including plugin filters) and re-created only the base filters.  So in
    effect, all plugin filters would be deleted whenever a filter checkbox was altered.

    So, we need some way of knowing which are the base filters so that we can take
    action when a filter checkbox is marked [or unmarked].  Then we can update
    the base filters by either deleting and recreating them, or by changing their
    active state in an intelligent manner.  I am choosing to do the latter.

    My goal here is to preserve the structure bfilter_t completely as it has been
    historically.  I feel that modifying bfilter_t is dangerous with respect to breaking
    plugins.  So what I'm doing instead is tracking which are the base filters via
    external array, baseFilters.  The array baseFilterExcludes keeps track of the "exclude"
    parameter for the corresponding filter.
