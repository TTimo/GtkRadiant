   \class CSynapseAPIManager
   derive from this class if you want to manage several APIs through the same object
   (typically, loading plugins, or an unknown number of APIs that match some criterions)
   this class has some pure virtual members that need to be implemented by the childs

   we deal with two types of API managers:
   - the 'loose' ones have a matching pattern and load everything that matches criterions
   typically used for plugins
   - the 'list' ones have a fixed list of things they require. They are used to provide
   easy access to multiple interfaces

   those two types of managers are not stored in the same structs, and not handled the
   same way. For instance the 'list' manager will require ALL it's APIs to be loaded, or
   the init will fail. They also play a role in the client activation.

   apart from the multiple API management facility, the main difference with static tables
   and individual calls to CSynapseClient::AddAPI is the fact that the APIDescriptor_t are
   allocated on demand
