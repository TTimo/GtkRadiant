MSI: installer bug with new folders? : create custom dir, click New Folder icon, type "FOLDER\" - gets stuck
GTK2: gtk2 crashes when trying to use bitmap fonts such as MS Sans Serif http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=142579
GTK2: alt+tab while mouse button is held down: see http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=145156
UI: changing resolution in floating-windows mode can screw up window positions.
HalfLife: half-life maps saved in q1 map format are not supported - currently have to convert them to hammer map format using hammer editor. And vice versa.
Entity: creating a new entity with all the brushes of another entity selected results in the latter entity having no brushes.
SConscript: build fails if SETUP=1
Brush: non-BP auto-texture-fit fails when rotation is 90

Doom3 startup asserts:
> .\eclass_doom3.cpp:342
> assertion failure: editor_color: parse error.
> .\eclass_doom3.cpp:357
> assertion failure: editor_mins: parse error.
> .\eclass_doom3.cpp:368
> assertion failure: editor_maxs: parse error.

can't use arrow keys to navigate in camera view when capslock is enabled
- connecting an entity to a path-corner renames the targetname of the path-corner, so if another entity E was linked to the path-corner, the link will be broken and you'll have to edit E and modify the target value

<gibbie> was looking around in 3dview and then autosave thingy came up and now i cant do anything anymore :(

upgrade to new API for SymGetModuleInfo


HIGH priority features

- paint-select or equivalent (e.g. area-selection with occlusion)
- select-complete-tall or equivalent (e.g. subtract-from-selection modifier key)
- texture pane names are often illegible, becuase 1. they are long and overlap each other and 2. they overlap the outline rectangles around the images themselves.
- texture sizes sometimes vary wildly.  It would be nice to find a way to normalize their display size so that very big textures are shrunk a little, and very small textures are blown-up a little.
- need some equivalent to select-inside.


Build: document build-menu xml format.
The build menu in GtkRadiant 1.5 is entirely customisable - you can make it run qbsp3/qvis3/arghrad or any tool you want. Use 'Build > Customize...' to edit the menu.

Menu commands are the shell commands that Radiant will execute when you choose the menu item. You can add as many commands as you want to a single menu item, and they will be executed in sequence. The commands contain variables, specified using []. The values of variables will be substituted when the command is executed.

For example:
<pre>[q2map] -bsp "[MapFile]"</pre>
becomes:
<pre>"C:\Program Files\GtkRadiant 1.5.0\q2map" -fs_basepath "c:\quake2" -bsp "c:\quake2\baseq2\maps\blah.map"</pre>
This uses the predefined variable 'MapFile' and the custom variable 'q2map'. 'q2map' is defined in the XML file, and 'MapFile' is the full path to your map.
The 'MapFile' variable is enclosed in quotes, because the path to your map may contain spaces.
At the moment you can only create custom variables by editing the XML file. A custom variable for arghrad would look something like this:
<pre><var name="arghrad">"[RadiantPath]arghrad"</var></pre>
This variable could then be used in a command like this:
<pre>[arghrad] "[MapFile]"</pre>
