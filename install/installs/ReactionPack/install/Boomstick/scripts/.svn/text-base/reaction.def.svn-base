This is not an entity as such, it never reaches the game. It is strictly an editor utility to project decals surfaces over world brushes
-------- KEYS --------
target : The name of the entity targetted at for projection.
-------- NOTES --------
Compiler-only entity that specifies a decal to be projected. Should contain 1 or more patch meshes (curves) and target an info_null entity. The distance between the center of the _decal entity and the target is the axis and distance of projection.*/

It can also emit sound if the "noise" key is set. Will crush the player when blocked.
-------- KEYS --------
speed : Amount of time in seconds for one complete oscillation cycle (default 4).
height : sets the amount of travel of the oscillation movement (default 32). 
phase : sets the start offset of the oscillation cycle. Values must be 0 < phase < 1. Any integer phase value is the same as no offset (default 0).
noise : path/name of .wav file to play. Use looping sounds only (eg. sound/world/drone6.wav - See Notes).
model2 : path/name of model to include (eg: models/mapobjects/jets/jets01.md3).

_lightmapscale : sets the sample size of the lightmap. A value of 1 (default) will create 16x16 pixel samples. A higher value generates smaller samples (for example a value of 2 will create 8x8 samples).
_castshadows;_cs : Allows per-entity control over shadow casting. Defaults to 0 on entities, 1 on world. 0 = no shadow casting. 1 = cast shadows on world. > 1 = cast shadows on entities with _rs (or _receiveshadows) with the corresponding value, AND world. Negative values imply same, but DO NOT cast shadows on world.
_receiveshadows;_rs : Allows per-entity control over shadow reception. Defaults to 1 on everything (world shadows). 0 = receives NO shadows. > 1 = receive shadows only from corresponding keyed entities (see above) and world. &lt; 1 = receive shadows ONLY from corresponding keyed entities.

In order for the sound to be emitted from the entity, it is recommended to include a brush with an origin shader at its center, otherwise the sound will not follow the entity as it moves. Setting the origin key is simply an alternate method to using an origin brush. When using the model2 key, the origin point of the model will correspond to the origin point defined by either the origin brush or the origin coordinate value.*/

notteam : when set to 1, entity will not spawn in "Teamplay" and "CTF" modes.
notsingle : when set to 1, entity will not spawn in Single Player mode (bot play mode).
-------- SPAWNFLAGS --------
CHIPPABLE : pieces will spawn when the entity is shot, but the entity will not be destroyed until the health of the entity is surpassed.
UNBREAKABLE : entity will never break. To make the entity chip, but never break, check the first two spawnflags. To make the entity chip and eventually break, only set the first spawnflag.
EXPLOSIVE : entity will explode.
NO_KICK : players will not be able to kick the entity.
-------- NOTES --------
Breakables are defined in sets by the 'type' key (e.g. type : glass, type : wood). Each set of unique keys used in a map must be given a unique id number (0-63; max 64 per map; no default value). Two different breakable entities with the same keys should have the same id. If two different breakable entities differ in type, force or lift they require separate id numbers.
Breakable types can also be defined in the worldspawn and used by their corresponding id's through the "type_id" key. See the worldspawn entity info for more details*/

-------- NOTES --------
By default, the total amount of vertical travel of a platform is implicitly determined by the overall vertical size of the brushes of which it's made minus the lip value. But if the "height" key is used, then the total amount of vertical travel of the plat will be exactly that value regardless of the shape and size of the plat and regardless of the value of the "lip" key. Using the "height" key is the best method for any kind of platforms and the only possible one for thin plats which need to travel vertical distances many times their own thickness. Setting the origin key is simply an alternate method to using an origin brush. When using the model2 key, the origin point of the model will correspond to the origin point defined by either the origin brush or the origin coordinate value.

There is a way to make plats play proper sounds. Just create a sound\movers\plats folder under baseq3 and put 2 sounds named pt1_strt.wav and pt1_end.wav in it. Those can be the renamed sounds from the Q2 plats or renamed copies of the sound\movers\doors sounds you can extract from your pak0.pk3 file or new custom sounds if you're up to it. Thanks to Fragzilla for the tip.*/

-------- SPAWNFLAGS --------
START_OFF : entity will start in the off position. 
-------- NOTES --------
When using the model2 key, the origin point of the model will correspond to the origin point defined by either the origin brush or the origin coordinate value. If a model is included with a targeted func_static, the brush(es) of the entity will be removed from the game but the .md3 model won't: it will automatically be moved to the (0 0 0) world origin so you should NOT include an .md3 model to a targeted func_static.

By default, when activated a visible func_static will be shown and an invisible one will be hidden. To alter this behaviour, you can use a "pathtarget" key for the entity that points to the func_static. Possible values are:
- "on" - will always show the targeted entity
- "off" - will always hide the targeted entity
Any other value for "pathtarget" will make the func_train take the default action.

Because the map has only a single bot navigation file, func_static's cannot be used to make significant changes in game play flow between differing game types.*/

wait : number of seconds func_train will pause on path corner before moving to next path corner. Setting this key to -1 will make the train stop on the path corner (default 0).
sound: path/name of .wav file to play (default silence).
notfree : when set to 1, entity will not spawn in "Free for all" and "Tournament" modes.
notteam : when set to 1, entity will not spawn in "Teamplay" and "CTF" modes.
notsingle : when set to 1, entity will not spawn in Single Player mode (bot play mode).
-------- SPAWNFLAGS --------
ROTATE: if set, the train will also rotate while moving from this path_corner to its target. A "rotate" key must also be included
-------- NOTES --------
In order to turn a func_train into a working elevator, the path corners must have the wait key set to -1. To get the train to move again, use the pathtarget key from a separate triggering entity pointing to another path corner.*/

TARGET_* ENTITIES

//=============================================================================

/*QUAKED target_activate (.3 .3 .4) (-8 -8 -8) (8 8 8)
Activates/deactivates other entities, like doors or triggers.
-------- KEYS --------
target : this must match the "activatename" field of the entities you want to activate/deactivate
pathtarget : if set to "on", the entity will always activate its targets; if set to "off", it'll always deactivate them; if set to anything else, the entity will toggle its targets active/inactive.
-------- NOTES --------
If you want an entity to be inactive when the level is started set its "inactive" key to 1.*/

//=============================================================================

/*QUAKED target_delay (0 .7 .7) (-8 -8 -8) (8 8 8)
Time delay trigger intermediary. Like a target_relay, this can only be fired by other triggers which will cause it in turn to fire its own targets.
-------- KEYS --------
targetname : activating trigger points to this.
target : this points to entities to activate when this entity is triggered.
pathtarget : will send a func_train to the path corner this key points to. Must be used in conjunction with the target key pointing to the targetname of the func_train.
targetShaderName: the original shader in a shader swap (see notes).
targetShaderNewName: new shader in a shader swap (see notes). 
wait : delay in seconds from when this gets triggered to when it fires its own targets (default approx. 1).
delay : same as wait? replaces it? WTF?...I'm confused now.
random : random time variance in seconds added or subtracted from the delay (default 0 - see Notes).
notfree : when set to 1, entity will not spawn in "Free for all" and "Tournament" modes.
notteam : when set to 1, entity will not spawn in "Teamplay" and "CTF" modes.
notsingle : when set to 1, entity will not spawn in Single Player mode (bot play mode).
-------- NOTES --------
When the random key is set, its value is used to calculate a minimum and a maximum delay. The final time delay will be a random value anywhere between the minimum and maximum values: (min delay = delay - random) (max delay = delay + random).
To initiate a shader swap, use the targetShaderName key with the original shader path as the argument. Note this is always the original shader, not the current shader. Use the targetShaderNewName key with the path to the replacement shader as the argument. The shader swap will affect every surface in the map that was originally showing the shader specified as the targetShaderName.*/

-------- NOTES --------
There are 2 ways to use this entity.
a) automatically give items to players when they spawn in the game: make a spawn location entity like info_player_deathmatch or CTF respawn points target this entity, then make it target the item(s) to give to the player upon respawn.
b) give items to players during the game: make a trigger_multiple target this entity, then make it target the item(s) to give to the player when the trigger is touched.*/

notteam : when set to 1, entity will not spawn in "Teamplay" and "CTF" modes.
notsingle : when set to 1, entity will not spawn in Single Player mode (bot play mode).*/

//=============================================================================

/*QUAKED target_location (0 .5 0) (-8 -8 -8) (8 8 8)
Location marker used by bots and players for team orders and team chat in the course of Teamplay games. The closest target_location in sight is used for the location. If none is in sight, the closest in distance is used.
-------- KEYS --------

Aiming target for entities like light, misc_portal_camera and trigger_push (jump pads) in particular.
-------- KEYS --------
targetname : the entity that requires an aiming direction points to this.
portalspeed : when this key is used with a sky portal, these 3 values indicate how much the sky portal should move in the player's view. Default is "0 0 0" - static portals. A good value would be "0.025 0.025 0.025" (similar to kibuye) or "0.025 0.025 0" (the latter would disable vertical portal movement).
notfree : when set to 1, entity will not spawn in "Free for all" and "Tournament" modes.
notteam : when set to 1, entity will not spawn in "Teamplay" and "CTF" modes.

//=============================================================================

/*QUAKED target_push (.5 .5 .5) (-8 -8 -8) (8 8 8) -
This can be used to create jump pads and launch ramps. The direction of push can be set by the "angles" key or pointing to a target_position or info_notnull entity. Unlike trigger_push, this is NOT client side predicted and must be activated by a trigger.
-------- KEYS --------
angles: this sets the pitch and yaw aiming angles of push entity (default 0 0). The roll angle does not apply.
speed : speed of push (default 1000). Has no effect if entity targets an aiming entity.
targetname : the activating trigger points to this. Push originates from the location of the trigger.
target : this points to the aiming entity to which the player will jump.
sound: path/name of .wav file to play. Defaults to silence (sound/misc/silence.wav).
notfree : when set to 1, entity will not spawn in "Free for all" and "Tournament" modes.
notteam : when set to 1, entity will not spawn in "Teamplay" and "CTF" modes.
notsingle : when set to 1, entity will not spawn in Single Player mode (bot play mode).
-------- NOTES --------
To make a jump pad or launch ramp, create a trigger_multiple where the jump must originate. Place the target_push directly above the trigger_multiple and place the target_position entity at the highest point of the jump. Target the trigger_multiple to the target_push and target the target_push to the target_position/info_notnull (or set the target_push's "angles" key). Note that the "angle" key also works.*/

/*QUAKED target_relay (0 .7 .7) (-8 -8 -8) (8 8 8) RED_ONLY BLUE_ONLY RANDOM
This can only be activated by other triggers which will cause it in turn to activate its own targets.
-------- KEYS --------
targetname : activating trigger points to this.
target : this points to entities to activate when this entity is triggered.
pathtarget : will send a func_train to the path corner this key points to. Must be used in conjunction with the target key pointing to the targetname of the func_train.
targetShaderName: the original shader in a shader swap (see notes).
targetShaderNewName: new shader in a shader swap (see notes).

-------- NOTES --------
To initiate a shader swap, use the targetShaderName key with the original shader path as the argument. Note this is always the original shader, not the current shader. Use the targetShaderNewName key with the path to the replacement shader as the argument. The shader swap will affect every surface in the map that was originally showing the shader specified as the targetShaderName.*/

//=============================================================================

/*QUAKED target_speaker (0 .7 .7) (-8 -8 -8) (8 8 8) LOOPED_ON LOOPED_OFF GLOBAL ACTIVATOR NOPVS
Sound generating entity that plays .wav files. Normal non-looping sounds play each time the target_speaker is triggered. Looping sounds can be set to play by themselves (no activating trigger) or be toggled on/off by a trigger.
-------- KEYS --------
noise : path/name of .wav file to play (eg. sound/world/growl1.wav - see Notes).
wait : delay in seconds between each time the sound is played ("random" key must be set - see Notes).
random : random time variance in seconds added or subtracted from "wait" delay ("wait" key must be set - see Notes).
targetname : the activating button or trigger points to this.
notfree : when set to 1, entity will not spawn in "Free for all" and "Tournament" modes.
notteam : when set to 1, entity will not spawn in "Teamplay" and "CTF" modes.
notsingle : when set to 1, entity will not spawn in Single Player mode (bot play mode).
-------- SPAWNFLAGS --------
LOOPED_ON : sound will loop and initially start on in level (will toggle on/off when triggered).
LOOPED_OFF : sound will loop and initially start off in level (will toggle on/off when triggered).
GLOBAL : sound will play full volume throughout the level.
ACTIVATOR : sound will play only for the player that activated the target.
NOPVS : by default, looping sounds are only played while in the player's PVS. Checking this spawnflag will make the sound play no matter if it's in the PVS or not.
-------- NOTES --------
The path portion value of the "noise" key can be replaced by the implicit folder character "*" for triggered sounds that belong to a particular player model. For example, if you want to create a "bottomless pit" in which the player screams and dies when he falls into, you would place a trigger_multiple over the floor of the pit and target a target_speaker with it. Then, you would set the "noise" key to "*falling1.wav". The * character means the current player model's sound folder. So if your current player model is Visor, * = sound/player/visor, if your current player model is Sarge, * = sound/player/sarge, etc. This cool feature provides an excellent way to create "player-specific" triggered sounds in your levels.

The combination of the "wait" and "random" keys can be used to play non-looping sounds without requiring an activating trigger but both keys must be used together. The value of the "random" key is used to calculate a minimum and a maximum delay. The final time delay will be a random value anywhere between the minimum and maximum values: (min delay = wait - random) (max delay = wait + random).*/

WORLDSPAWN ENTITY

//=============================================================================

/*QUAKED worldspawn (0 0 0) ?
Only used for the world.
-------- KEYS --------
message : text to print at user logon. Used for name of level.
music : path/name of looping .wav file used for level's music (eg. music/sonic5.wav).
ambient : adds a constant value to overall lighting. High values are not recommended. Ambient light will have a tendency to flatten out variations in light and shade.
_color : RGB value for ambient light color.
_rq3_fog_color : if set, the game will fill the screen with this color before drawing the actual scene. Useful for replacing the q3map2 foghulls
vertexremapshader : sets a shader to be used in vertex light mode instead of a normal shader. Value : normal_shader;vertex_shader (note the semi-colon). As many shaders can be remapped as needed by using the key. However, if more than one shader is remapped in a map, each one must have a unique identifier  either a number or a letter after the Key word, as shown by vertexremapshaderX, where X is a number or any character set. Examples, vertexremapshader01, vertexremapshader02, vertexremapshaderA, vertexremapshaderB, etc.
gravity : gravity of level (default is normal gravity: 800).
gridsize : granularity of the lightgrid created by q3map. Value is three integers separated by spaces, representing number of units between grid points in X Y Z. Default gridsize value is 128 128 256. Use larger powers of 2 to reduce BSP size and compile time on very large maps.
_blocksize : q3map always splits the BSP tree along the planes X=_blocksize*n and Y=_blocksize*n. Default _blocksize value is 1024. Increase the blocksize using larger powers of 2 to reduce compile times on very large maps with a low structural brush density.
-------- Q3MAP2 KEYS --------
_minlight : raises ambient light only where it's less than the minlight value (dark areas) and leaves the rest of your map alone.
_minvertexlight : (see above)
_mingridlight : Minimum lightgrid (dynamic entity lighting) levelwide.
_keeplights : Keep light entities in the BSP. Normally stripped out by the BSP process and read from the .map file by the lighting phase.
_noshadersun : shader suns still work, but this is a method to override/do_not_use shader suns, and only use entity suns. I.e., supresses q3map_sun in your sky shaders.
_farplanedist : Limit on how many units the vis phase of compilation can see. Used in combination with level-wide fog, it can help reduce r_speeds on large, open maps.
_foghull : Shader to use for "fog hull." Foghull shader should be a sky shader. Omit the "textures/" prefix.
_lightmapscale : sets the sample size of the lightmap. A value of 1 (default) will create 16x16 pixel samples. A higher value generates smaller samples (for example a value of 2 will create 8x8 samples). Can be overridden in func_group (or other entities).
_castshadows;_cs : Allows per-entity control over shadow casting. Defaults to 0 on entities, 1 on world. 0 = no shadow casting. 1 = cast shadows on world. > 1 = cast shadows on entities with _rs (or _receiveshadows) with the corresponding value, AND world. Negative values imply same, but DO NOT cast shadows on world.</integer>
_receiveshadows;_rs : Allows per-entity control over shadow reception. Defaults to 1 on everything (world shadows). 0 = receives NO shadows. > 1 = receive shadows only from corresponding keyed entities (see above) and world. &lt; 1 = receive shadows ONLY from corresponding keyed entities.</integer>
_celshader : Sets the cel shader used for this geometry. Note: omit the "textures/" prefix. Overridable in entities.
-------- Q3MAP2 TERRAIN KEYS --------
_indexmap;alphamap : Path/name for the art file used to guide the mapping of textures on the terrain surface.
_layers;layers : Integer value is the number unique root shaders that will be use on the terrain.
_shader;shader : Path to the metashader used to assign textures to the terrain entity. Note: Omit the "textures/" prefix.
-------- RQ3 KEYS --------
numbreakabletypes : the number of breakable types to be defined in the worldspawn (0 by default)
b#i_type (where #i is a number between 0 and numbreakabletypes - 1, e.g. "b3_type". These are the id's of the breakable types) : breakable type #i (e.g. "glass", "wood_mahogany" etc.)
b#i_force, b#i_lift : the same as the "force" and "lift" keys from func_breakables. These two are optional, unlike the "b#i_type" key. If the "b#i_type" key is ommitted, then the code will skip to the next breakable definition (if there is one).
atmosphere : The supported atmospheric effects are 'rain' and 'snow'. The format string is something like: T=RAIN,B=5 10,C=0.5,G=0.5 2,BV=0,GV=0 100,W=1 2,D=300 

The type must always come first (T=RAIN). The fields are as follows: 

Key Default Description: 
T RAIN Type of effect (supports 'rain' or 'snow') 
B 5 10 Base times (X seconds, or between X and Y seconds) 
C 1 1 Time to move from base to gust (X seconds, or between X and Y seconds) 
G 0 2 Gust times (X seconds, or between X and Y seconds) 
BV 0 100 Base vector (x and y units/sec). 
GV 0 100 Gust vector (x and y units/sec). 
W 1 2 Weight of drops (X, or from X to Y depending on base/gust position) 
S 1 1 Water and Splash shader. This are two boolean values, the first enables impactshaders on water (0 = off, 1 = on), the second on land. 
D 300 300 Number of drops (X, or from X to Y depending on base/gust position)*/

/*QUAKED RQ3ammo_m4 (.3 .3 1) (-8 -8 -8) (8 8 8) SUSPENDED
M4 ammo. Gives the player 1 clip by default.
-------- KEYS --------
wait : time in seconds before item respawns after being picked up (default 40, -1 = never respawn).
random : random time variance in seconds added or subtracted from "wait" delay (default 0 - see Notes).
team : set this to team items. Teamed items will respawn randomly after team master is picked up (see Notes).
target : picking up the item will trigger the entity this points to.
targetname : a target_give entity can point to this for respawn freebies.
notbot : used to make an item invisible for bot attraction. 
-------- SPAWNFLAGS --------
SUSPENDED : item will spawn where it was placed in map and won't drop to the floor.
-------- NOTES --------
The amount of time it takes for an item in the team to respawn is determined by the "wait" value of the item that was picked up previously. So if one of the items in the team has it's "wait" key set to -1 (never respawn), the random respawning cycle of the teamed items will stop after that item is picked up.

When the random key is set, its value is used to calculate a minimum and a maximum delay. The final time delay will be a random value anywhere between the minimum and maximum values: (min delay = wait - random) (max delay = wait + random).

/*QUAKED RQ3ammo_mk23 (.3 .3 1) (-8 -8 -8) (8 8 8) SUSPENDED
MK23 pistol ammo. Gives the player 1 clip by default.
-------- KEYS --------
wait : time in seconds before item respawns after being picked up (default 40, -1 = never respawn).
random : random time variance in seconds added or subtracted from "wait" delay (default 0 - see Notes).
team : set this to team items. Teamed items will respawn randomly after team master is picked up (see Notes).
target : picking up the item will trigger the entity this points to.
targetname : a target_give entity can point to this for respawn freebies.
notbot : used to make an item invisible for bot attraction.
-------- SPAWNFLAGS --------
SUSPENDED : item will spawn where it was placed in map and won't drop to the floor.
-------- NOTES --------
The amount of time it takes for an item in the team to respawn is determined by the "wait" value of the item that was picked up previously. So if one of the items in the team has it's "wait" key set to -1 (never respawn), the random respawning cycle of the teamed items will stop after that item is picked up.

When the random key is set, its value is used to calculate a minimum and a maximum delay. The final time delay will be a random value anywhere between the minimum and maximum values: (min delay = wait - random) (max delay = wait + random).
