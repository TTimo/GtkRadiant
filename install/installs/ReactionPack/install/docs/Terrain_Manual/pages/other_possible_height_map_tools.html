<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are even some editors for other (non-fps) games that can be used to
manipulate a surface in 3D and then output a .bmp format file. It is worth
noting that we found it particularly challenging to use them … possibly more
challenging than the benefits of working in 3D.</p>
<b>
<p>SC3K Map Editor</p>
</b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first of these programs was a terrain editor for SimCity3000 called the
SC3K Map Editor from Tenermerx. It is a free download available here: <a href="http://www.tenermerx.com/sc3maped/" target="_blank">sc3maped</a></p>
<b>
<p>Loathing</p>
</b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The other editor we tried was the “Loathing” terrain editor that comes
with Bungie’s Myth II game. If you’ve a copy of Myth II, this is something
you could play around with. Both of these programs could output a .bmp format
file. If you’ve used it to make some Myth II maps you may have some idea of
how it works already. It is my opinion that if you use an editor for either of
these two games to create your height map, you may still want to or need to
manipulate it in an art program. If you can visualize the relationship between
shades of gray and relative heights and slopes, the art program is probably the
easier way to go.</p>
<b>
<p>Pencils, paintbrushes and a scanner</p>
</b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You can also make your heightmap by painting it by traditional methods and
then scanning in the file and saving it as a .bmp. Though at some point you’ll
probably want to switch over to digital manipulation.</p>
