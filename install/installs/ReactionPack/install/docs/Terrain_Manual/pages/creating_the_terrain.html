<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although it’s not necessarily the only way to develop a piece of terrain,
thinking of it and creating it as “mesh” of triangular brushes may be the
easiest way to work initially. The terrain sections for Quake III: Team Arena
were built in this manner, though each designer went about it in slightly
different ways.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our primary tool was a plugin for <a href="http://www.qeradiant.com/" target="_blank"> Q3Radiant</a> , created by David Hyde, called
<a href="http://tarot.telefragged.com/gensurf/" target="_blank">GenSurf</a>. The tool was originally created for Quake 2 (and may have been around
longer) and has been adapted for use with many of the game engines using Quake,
Quake2 and Quake3 technology. The basic concept behind GenSurf is that it can
create and export a group of brushes (or curve patches) to Q3Radiant that have
the look of “natural” terrain about them. Within the plug-in, the mapmaker
has control over the horizontal dimensions of the terrain entity, the steepness
of the slopes it creates, and the number of columns and rows of triangles that
it subdivides into.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The terrain can be generated from within the tool by using simple waveforms,
more complex mathematical expressions, fractal calculations, or height maps. The
last item, height maps, is in our opinion, the route to take for creating
complex, visually interesting terrain layouts. A height map is a piece of art
(we rendered them in grayscale) that GenSurf uses as a template for establishing
the height of vertexes (the points where the corners of the terrain triangles
meet). GenSurf interprets the color of the pixel (or more correctly the
numerical color value of the pixel) that corresponds to the location of the
vertex. Generally, the darker the gray value, the lower in height the vertex
(256 unique height values corresponding to 256 pixel colors). GenSurf then uses
the vertexes to define the extents of triangles and suddenly, one has a terrain
surface. Of course, there are a few details of construction between start and
finish …</p>
