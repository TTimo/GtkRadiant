<h1>5 Editor specific shader instructions</h1>
These instructions only affect the texture when it is seen in the Q3Radiant editor. They should be grouped with the surface
parameters but ahead of them in sequence.

<h2><a name = "edimg">5.1 qer_editorimage &lt;texture path/texturename&gt;</a></h2>
This keyword creates a shader name in memory, but in the editor, it displays the TGA art image specified in qer_editorimage (in the example below this is textures/eerie/lavahell.tga).

<p>The editor maps a texture using the size attributes of the TGA file used for the editor image. When that editor image represents a shader, any texture used in any of the shader stages will be scaled up or down to the dimensions of the editor image. If a 128x128 pixel image is used to represent the shader in the editor, then a 256x256 image used in a later stage will be shrunk to fit. A 64x64 image would be stretched to fit. Be sure to check this on bouncy, acceleration, and power-uppads placed on surfaces other than 256 x 256. Use <b>tcMod scale</b> to change the size of the stretched
texture. Rememberthat <b>tcMod scale</b> 0.5 0.5 will double your image, while <b>tcMod scale</b> 2 2will halve it.

<p><div class = "tip"><b>Design Notes:</b> The base_light and gothic_light shaders contain numerous uses of this. It can be very useful for making different light styles (mostly to change the light brightnesses) without having to create a new piece of TGA art for each new shader.</div>

<h2><a name = "nocarve">5.2 qer_nocarve</a></h2>
A brush marked with this instruction will not be affected by CSG subtract functions. It is especially useful for water and fog textures.

<h2><a name = "trans">5.3 qer_trans &lt;value&gt;</a></h2>
This parameter defines the percentage of transparency that a brush will have when seen in the editor (no effect on game
rendering a tall). It can have a positive value between 0 and 1. The higher the value, the less transparent the texture.
Example: qer_trans 0.2 means the brush is 20% opaque and nearly invisible.
