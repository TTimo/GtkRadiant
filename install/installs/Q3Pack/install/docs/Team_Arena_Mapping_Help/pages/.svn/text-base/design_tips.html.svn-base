          <blockquote>
            <p><font size="3"> <font FACE="Times New Roman">The skull
            generator in Harvester tosses skulls about it to a maximum distance
            of 96 units. The id map designers usually allowed for a drop radius
            of 104 to 128 units as a minimum. As a rule, the generator should
            drop skulls only in a places accessible to the players. Skulls
            should not drop out into death fog or the void.</font></font></p>
            <p><font size="3"> <font FACE="Times New Roman">Where you place
            the persistent team power-ups is really more a matter of personal
            style than a fixed requirement. Generally speaking, we found having
            all or most of them in easy view of the initial start positions was
            a good thing. In some cases, we found that placing the scout in a
            contested area made for interesting game challenges.</font></font></p>
            <p><font size="3"> <font FACE="Times New Roman">It is not
            necessary to put every team power-up on every map. If a team
            power-up would be overpowering on a map, leave it out. If you study
            the id team maps, you뭠l note that not every map has every power
            up. In a small map, the scout can be unreasonable. In a map where
            the base is easily attacked and overwhelmed, the guard can unbalance
            things. In a map where the base is easily defended by snipers, the
            doubler is powerful.</font></font></p>
            <p><font size="3"> <font FACE="Times New Roman">For One Flag CTF,
            the flag should be placed in an area that is roughly equidistant
            from both bases and can be easily reached by players from either
            team.</font></font></p>
            <p><font size="3"> <font FACE="Times New Roman">The same (as
            above) is true for Harvester.</font></font></p>
            <p><font size="3"> <font FACE="Times New Roman">You don뭪 have
            to place the white flag and the Harvester skull generator in the
            same place in the map.</font></font></p>
            <p><font size="3"> <font FACE="Times New Roman">Don뭪 feel
            obligated to put the CTF flag bases, the skull receptacles, and the
            Overload skull obelisk in the exact same location in the bases. Just
            remember to mark gametypes correctly.</font></font></p>
            <p><font size="3"> <font FACE="Times New Roman">Don뭪 include a
            kamikaze in a map where players are unlikely to ever see the full
            effect of the explosion.</font></font></p>
            <p><font size="3"> <font FACE="Times New Roman">The personal
            teleporter entity takes the player to a deathmatch spawn. That뭩
            how we restricted where the player teleported to in some maps.</font></font></p>
            <p><font size="3"> <font FACE="Times New Roman">When converting
            Q3A CTF maps with small base areas around their flags will probably
            need to have their bases enlarged to accommodate the Overload skull
            obelisk.</font></font></p>
            <p><font size="3"> <font FACE="Times New Roman">OVERLOAD: When
            designing the base for the placement of the skull obelisk, don뭪
            make it easy for attackers to shoot the obelisk from protected
            locations.</font></font></p>
            <p><font size="3"> <font FACE="Times New Roman">FLOOR ARROWS: The
            graphic arrows were added to map floors to help the players find
            their ways through potentially confusing arenas and to give the
            player a sense of how close to the flag room he or she might be. The
            rule of thumb was that the greater the distance to the flag, the
            more stripes or bars would follow the arrow. Exact style of arrow
            use varied from mapper to mapper. Study the individual maps to
            determine which works best for your own map. The floor arrows act
            like decals (if you ever built plastic model kits, these are the
            little graphic things that you soaked in water and then stuck on the
            surfaces of the model). The images will appear to be a part of the
            surface upon which they rest. For the arrows, you will want to build
            them as nodraw brushes of the proper dimension with a surface raised
            about 2 units above the floor or wall. For the arrow, use
            missionpack/proto2/bluea_dcl for the blue arrows and missionpack/proto2/reda_dcl
            for the red. You may have to scale and rotate the texture to get
            what you want. For more than three trailing bars, add additional
            decals and arrange to suit.</font></font></p>
