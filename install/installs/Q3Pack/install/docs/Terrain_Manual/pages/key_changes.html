  <p>· </font><font FACE="Times New Roman">A variant of the func_group entity
  has been added to the game. When a func_group of brushes (only) is given a
  terrain key and a numerical value (an ID number for that terrain) and several
  other key attributes, it becomes a terrain entity and is treated differently
  than other brushes during the compile.</p>
  </font><font FACE="Symbol">
  <p>· </font><font FACE="Times New Roman">The map area has been expanded to
  128,000 units in all extents (256,000 units on any edge of the map volume).
  While this does not mean that a map that large could actually run on current
  game hardware, it does give the designer room to explore what the actual
  limits may be. As a point of reference, mpterra2.bsp is roughly 12K x 16K x 3K
  units in size … the largest map in the game by far.</p>
  </font><font FACE="Symbol">
  <p>· </font><font FACE="Times New Roman">A terrain texture mapping system
  plots textures across the terrain entity using a specially created .pcx or .tga
  art file as a map for planar projecting and blending shaders on terrain
  surfaces.</p>
  </font><font FACE="Symbol">
  <p>· </font><font FACE="Times New Roman">A “meta-shader” is used to
  organize and calculate blends between the shaders that are mapped onto the
  terrain.</p>
  </font><font FACE="Symbol">
  <p>· </font><font FACE="Times New Roman">Textures designed for use under
  vertex lighting can be substituted at map load time for more complex shader-manipulated
  textures that may not look correct in a vertex light only situation.</p>
